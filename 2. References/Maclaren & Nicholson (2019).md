Found after googling "[[causal inference]]" and "[[inverse problem]]" together.

States that causal inference is a subcategory of inverse problems.
More precisely, "causal inference is in general an ill-posed inverse problem". This means that a causal inference problem may either have no solutions, or if a solution is found, it is likely not unique; in addition, solutions may not be stable. (By 'stability' I assume they mean: a bit of noise in the data does not change the solution much. If it does, the solving method is unstable. This is how "stability" was used in my numerical linear algebra and numerical computing courses).
